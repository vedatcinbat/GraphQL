# GraphQL APIs Learning Roadmap

## Beginner Level

1. **Introduction to GraphQL**
   - What is GraphQL?
   - Differences between GraphQL and REST.
   - Key concepts: queries, mutations, and subscriptions.

2. **Setting Up Your Development Environment**
   - Overview of required tools (Node.js, .NET Core SDK, Go, etc.).
   - Installing and configuring your preferred IDE or code editor.
   - Overview of package managers and dependency management.

3. **Basic GraphQL Concepts & Schema Design**
   - Defining types, queries, mutations, and resolvers.
   - Writing your first GraphQL schema.
   - Using GraphQL Playground/GraphiQL for testing queries.

## Intermediate Level

4. **Building GraphQL APIs with Express**
   - Introduction to Express and integrating Apollo Server.
   - Setting up a simple GraphQL server with Express.
   - Creating resolvers and integrating a basic data source.

5. **GraphQL with NestJS**
   - Introduction to NestJS and its module-based architecture.
   - Two approaches: Code-First vs. Schema-First.
   - Building a simple API with resolvers and dependency injection.

6. **GraphQL in .NET Core**
   - Overview of GraphQL libraries for .NET (HotChocolate, GraphQL.NET).
   - Creating a GraphQL server in an ASP.NET Core application.
   - Defining types, queries, and mutations in C#.

7. **Building GraphQL APIs with Gin (Go)**
   - Introduction to the Gin framework and Go basics.
   - Using a GraphQL library for Go (like gqlgen).
   - Setting up the schema and writing resolvers.

8. **Hands-On Project: Building a Simple API**
   - Develop a small project (e.g., a Todo API) using one of the frameworks.
   - Compare implementation details across different frameworks.

## Advanced Level

9. **Advanced Schema Design**
   - Best practices in designing scalable GraphQL schemas.
   - Managing schema complexity and versioning.
   - Techniques for pagination, filtering, and sorting.

10. **Authentication & Authorization**
    - Implementing authentication with tokens (JWT, OAuth).
    - Role-based access control in resolvers.
    - Securing GraphQL endpoints.

11. **Performance Optimization & Caching**
    - Understanding query performance and complexity.
    - Using DataLoader for batching and caching.
    - Strategies for monitoring and optimizing performance.

12. **Real-Time Data with Subscriptions**
    - Implementing GraphQL subscriptions for real-time communication.
    - Setting up WebSocket connections.
    - Use cases and handling state in subscriptions.

13. **Testing & Debugging GraphQL APIs**
    - Unit and integration testing strategies.
    - Tools for debugging GraphQL APIs (e.g., GraphQL Playground, Apollo Client DevTools).
    - Error handling best practices.

14. **Error Handling & Security Best Practices**
    - Graceful error handling and meaningful error messages.
    - Input validation and query depth limiting.
    - Protecting against common GraphQL security vulnerabilities.

15. **Advanced Integrations**
    - Federation and schema stitching to build a distributed GraphQL architecture.
    - Integrating GraphQL with microservices.
    - Offline-first approaches and client-side caching strategies.

16. **Deployment & Scaling GraphQL APIs**
    - Deployment strategies for cloud and on-premise.
    - Setting up CI/CD pipelines.
    - Monitoring, logging, and scaling strategies for production environments.

17. **Case Studies & Real-World Applications**
    - Review of real-world GraphQL implementations.
    - Discussion of industry best practices and lessons learned.
    - Troubleshooting common challenges in production systems.
